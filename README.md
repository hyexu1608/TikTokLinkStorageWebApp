# TikTokVideoLinkStorageWebApp
Implement a web application from which a content manager can store the link of a tiktok video. Once there are eight videos in the database, 
user can go ahead and choose which of two random videos they prefer. 
This continues until they have provided enough preferences to give a good "best" video, using the pagerank algorithm.
